1) Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This automatically tests the code to check if it runs correctly. Manual test takes too much time, and after all development is completed will be too late to check the errors.

2) YES. It tests user actions on the functions, hence it checks for correct result.

3) NO. The change on message won't affect the unit test.
   
4) YES. It can test for properties of the feature, thus "max message length" can be tested by Unit Testing.
